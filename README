Period-2 Node.js, Express + JavaScript & Backend Testing

By Bente Andersen

This file is meant to give you an overwiev of this hand in. I will make one file for each question, but the example
code for this hand in will come from two different git-hub repositories I have made. I will link to these through here,
and tell you where to look for what in each question.

The repositories are named:

JSPeriod2-NodelExpress-JokeApiEx - https://github.com/Bente80/JSPeriod2-NodelExpress-JokeApiEx
* This project is my solution to the questions found in ExpressExercises.df, and ex 4&5 in TestExercises.pdf found on
  Fronter.

JSPeriod2-NodeExpress-Test - https://github.com/Bente80/JSPeriod2-NodeExpress-Test
* This project covers the Basic Mocca/chai testing and Asynchronous in TestExercises.pdf.
