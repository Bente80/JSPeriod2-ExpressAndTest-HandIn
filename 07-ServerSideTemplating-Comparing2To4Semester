07. Compare the express strategy toward (server side) templating with the one you used with Java on second
    semester.

A web template system uses a template processor to combine web templates to form finished web pages, possibly using
some data source to customize the pages or present a large amount of content on similar-looking pages. Server side
templating can be characterized like this: The controller gets some data from the model and pass it on to the view.
The view then sends some data back to the controller, and then back to the model.

On second semester we only used JavaServer Pages (JSP) for presentation and Java to write the logical behavior.
JSP encapsulates layout so it could be reused instead of replicated.

    2. sem: Model-->Controller --> Servlet – JSP

Here on fourth semester we use the javaScript and express to render a html page, based on some logical expressions.
Express ships out of the box, in an absolute minimum configuration. Therefore we must choose an template engine.
Unlike on 2. sem in Express there are many to choose from, all with different syntax. The following 3 are though
widely used:
    ·Jade
    ·EJS (Embedded JavaScript)
    ·Handlebars

    4. sem: Model --> Controller/Router --> Jade/EJS/Handlebars ex.

Jade is a simple templating language, with a whitespace-significant syntax. It's very clean without the normal
HTML tags ex.<> around the tag names.
        doctype html
        html
          head
            title Static Jade
            meta(name="description", content="Static Jade")
          body
            h1 Static Jade
            p You can think of Jade as shorthand for HTML. Tag names are "naked" and start most lines. Indentation dicates element nesting. Period (.) and hash (#) are short hand for CSS classes and IDs. For example <tt>ol#groceries.colorful</tt> produces an ordered list HTML tag with <tt>class="colorful"</tt> and <tt>id="groceries"</tt>.

            ol#groceries.colorful
              li Apples
              li Oranges
              li Bananas

            p These are the basics. See <a href="http://jade-lang.com">the Jade website</a> for many more details.

EJS (Embedded JavaScript) combines data and a template to produce HTML.
        <h1> <%= title %> </h1>
        <ul>
        <% for(var i=0; i<supplies.length; i++) {%>
           <li><%= supplies[i] %></li>
        <% } %>
        </ul>

Handlebars templates look like regular HTML, with embedded handlebars expressions.
        <div class="entry">
            <h1>{{title}}</h1>
            <div class="body">
                {{body}}
            </div>
        </div>
* A handlebars expression is a {{, some contents, followed by a }}
